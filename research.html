<h2 id="paper-three">What Drives Beliefs about Climate Risks? Evidence from Financial Analysts</h2>
<div style="clear: center;">

<div style="clear: justify;">
    <p>Author:  Matilde Faralli (ICL)  </p>

    <p  style="  margin: 0px;"> <small> Abstract: This paper aims to understand how beliefs about climate physical risks (risks of weather events) are formed and how these beliefs affect financial forecasts. I start by developing the first conceptual framework of belief formation about climate risks along the lines of the Experience-Based Learning model of Malmendier and Nagel (2011). Then,  to micro-fund the drivers of climate beliefs, I construct a novel dataset with geolocalized salient natural disasters and equity analysts in 29 different US states covering 6,846 firms from 1999 to 2020. Using a staggered differences-in-difference methodology, I study variations in analysts’ earnings forecasts after experiencing an exogenous weather shock. In line with previous studies, my finding suggests that analysts, after experiencing a salient weather shock, have lower forecast bias and error. I find that analysts with high ex-ante performance update their forecasts only for firms with high climate physical risks. Contrarily, low-performance analysts become more pessimistic about all firms, disregarding firms' climate exposure. The results indicate that high-performance analysts acquire new information from experiencing salient weather events, while low-performance analysts are affected by availability heuristics.   </small>   </p>

<h2 id="paper-two">The Rise of Climate Risks: Evidence on Firms' Expected Default Frequencies</h2>

    <p> <small> Abstract: This paper studies the relationship between climate risk and credit risk. We find a negative correlation between emission levels and default risk once firm's fixed characteristics are taken into account. By breaking down Moody's Expected Default Frequencies (EDFs) into its main components, we are able to uncover the drivers of this result. First, we show that carbon emissions are relevant for the probability of default, especially through the asset volatility channel. Second, we provide evidence that the 2015 Paris Agreement marked a policy turning point that reverberated on firms’ credit risk. After 2015, our results suggest that firms with high carbon footprints became riskier. We observe that this relation is driven by a decrease (increase) in asset volatility of small (large) emitters. With this analysis, we shed light on the channels through which climate risks affect credit risk, highlighting a number of aspects to consider when including climate risk in credit risk-related analyses. </small> </p>

<h2 id="paper-one">On the Benefits of Repaying</h2>

    <p> <small> Abstract: This paper studies whether countries benefit from servicing their debts during times of widespread sovereign defaults. Colombia is typically regarded as the only large Latin American country that did not default in the 1980s. Using archival research and formal econometric estimates of Colombia's probability of default, we show that in the early 1980s Colombia's fundamentals were not significantly different from those of the Latin American countries that defaulted on their debts. We also document that the different path chosen by Colombia was due to the authorities' belief that maintaining a good reputation in the international capital market would have substantial long-term payoffs. We show that the case of Colombia is more complex than what it is commonly assumed. Although Colombia had to re-profile its debts, high-level political support from the US allowed Colombia do to so outside the standard framework of an IMF program. Our counterfactual analysis shows that in the short to medium run, Colombia benefited from avoiding an explicit default. Specifically, we find that GDP growth in the 1980s was higher than that of a counterfactual in which Colombia behaved like its neighboring countries. We also test whether Colombia's behavior in the 1980s led to long-term reputational benefits. Using an event study based on a large sudden stop, we find no evidence for such long-lasting reputational gains.</small> </p>
